## 📝 Notes
- [Wigle.net](http://wigle.net/) is a website that consolidates location and other data on wireless networks around the world. This data is collected by volunteers who download an app to their phones and the app logs all the AP's they encounter and their GPS coordinates. All this data is then fed into the Wigle database. This data is then presented to users in an easy-to-use website and app like below.
