#  EvilTree

## 📝 Notes
- A standalone python3 remake of the classic "tree" command with the additional feature of searching for user provided keywords/regex in files, highlighting those that contain matches. Created for two main reasons:

	-   While searching for secrets in files of nested directory structures, being able to visualize which files contain user provided keywords/regex patterns and where those files are located in the hierarchy of folders, provides a significant advantage.
	-   "tree" is an amazing tool for analyzing directory structures. It's really handy to have a standalone alternative of the command for post-exploitation enumeration as it is not pre-installed on every linux distro and is kind of limited on Windows (compared to the UNIX version).
